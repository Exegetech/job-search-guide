# Applying in Style

**At the Phone Screen**

If they don't give it to you, ask for your intervier's contact information, "in case you have any questions".

Then email them a short thank-you note on the same evening.

**At the Technical Interview**

Here too ask for your interviewers' contact information if they don't give it first.

*"It was great to meet you. Do you have a card in case I have any more questions?"*

Again, email each of your interviewers a short thank-you note on the same evening. Make it different for each one by commenting on something you talked about at the interview.

*"I appreciate what you said about the emphasis on testing at [company name]. I value the fexibility that comes with testing and would love to work with like-minded engineers to learn and share best practices."*

It's ok to be cheesy. Cheesy people are easier to work with than cynics.
