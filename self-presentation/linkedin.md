# Link Yourself In

Your LinkedIn profile matters. Some companies ignore your résumé and look only at your LinkedIn. Additionally, in-house recruiters rely on LinkedIn to scout talent. You can think of your LinkedIn profile as an exercize in search engine optimization.    


## Layout

Unlike your résumé, you don't have to delete all non-web-related experience from your LinkedIn.
But if you are going to keep non-web-related items, put them at the bottom of your page.

Your layout might look like this:    
1. Summary    
2. Skills & Expertise    
3. Projects    
4. Education / Experience (whichever is most impressive)    


## Content

**Headers**
A profile picture helps viewers feel like they're getting to know you.

Your title is 'web developer' ("full stack" implies a couple years' experience).
You can add "for hire" or something to that effect in your title.

**Summary**

 Make your summary exciting. Show your enthusiasm!    
* Mention that you are looking for opportunities    
* List your main skills: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Backbone...    

These skills are also keywords that will stick out to employers. Throw in a couple buzzwords like "TDD", "pair-programming", MVC, REST...

[CJ's summary][cj-linkedin] is a great example. (For students on the East Coast CJ is a TA in San Francisco.)


**Skills and Expertise**

 Include all web-related skills here.
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* SQL
* Git
* HTML
* CSS
* Web Development

Delete non-web- or tech-related skills. You don't want to be a jack of all trades.

**Projects**

LinkedIn makes it easy to link to your personal projects. Employers will love that. It also looks cool if you worked on a project with someone else and list them as a collaborator. It shows you like to work in teams!
