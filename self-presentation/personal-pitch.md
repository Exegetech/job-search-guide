# Prepare your Pitch

"So, tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

Unnatural as it feels, this formality can score you a lot of points at an interview. Its main purpose is to spare your interviewer the burden of reading your résumé carefully. But since your answer will be longer than most things you say through the rest of the conversation, your interviewer is likely to sit back, listen to you talk, and ask him/herself "do I take this candidate seriously?".

If you're good at selling yourself, this is where you shine. Otherwise no worries. A 1 minute, well-rehearsed spiel is all you need to sound prepared and professional.


## Your 60-second life's story

 A sample outline for your inspiration:
* In college I chose to major in [...] // took a lot of classes in [...] because I like working on problems that involve [...]
* At [company] I accomplished [...] and [...] While I was at it I learned [...].
* I've always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun.
* When I picked up Ruby, I immediately got hooked.
* I wanted to take it to the next level so I took some classes.
    * *Feel free to bring up App Academy if they ask for details. Also mention online courses like Ruby Monk.*
* Now I know I want to make this my career.

*Note: if you finished college more than 4 years ago, your life story starts with your first job after graduation (unless you did something really cool before).*



## Questions to expect

Have a 30-second (or less) answer ready for each of these. It looks bad if you hesitate or stammer.

* How did you hear about us?
* Why do you want to be a programmer?
* Where do you see yourself five years down the road?
* How did you teach yourself to program?
    * Here it makes sense to bring up App Academy.
* How do you go about picking up a new technology?
* Walk me through your development process for a new project.
    * Pro moves: mapping out database relations, listing specifications for the controllers, writing tests, sketching out the views...
* Why do you want to work at our company?
* What kinds of problems do you like to work on?
* What was the hardest coding project you ever did?
* What work have you done that you are most proud of?
* What do you like about Ruby?
    * Common answers: readable, object-oriented
* What do you like about Rails?
    * Common answer: "convention over configuration"


## Bonus

We've observed these quirky questions a lot. A quick and enthusiastic response will make you shine.

*"Tell me about an interesting problem you solved."*    
A lot of great options here. Your answer doesn't have to be from a personal project. For example using the Ruby object as a simple data structure to store association parameters when you were cloning [Active-Record][active-record-lite] was pretty sweet.

*What's your favorite algorithm?*    
*What's your favorite data structure?*    
*What's your favorite Ruby gem (other than Rails)?*

## Prep time!

Outline your 60-second life story following the model above.    
Find the student you paired with on W1D1 of App Academy. Pick a famous tech company and ask them the big questions:

* "Tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and why do you want to work at [famous company]?"
* Why do you want to be a programmer?
* How did you teach yourself to program?

Then rotate, give each other feedback, and do it all again once more.

This will help you sound a lot more professional at your interview. On top of this, you can observe your interviewer and build a connection more easily if you're not trying to come up with answers on the spot.
