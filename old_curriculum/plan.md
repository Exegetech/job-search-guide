# Getting Jobbed

You must find a job within the next 9 weeks. It will not be easy. Take
solace only in your skills and your hustle. Know that you are going
through this with your classmates, and know that many have successfully
gone before you.

## Real Talk

You have learned well. If you've made it through the formal training
part of App Academy, you have real-world, valuable skills that companies
in the SF Bay Area want and need. Fundamentally, you have everything you
need to find a good, well-paying job in software development.

You have doubts. You're not sure if you're good enough. You're scared of
getting rejected. All normal. What you'll need over the next 3-9 weeks
is not so much confidence as **hustle**. If you put in the work -
study, practice, apply - you'll do well. 

Here is the story successful job hunters tell: they applied to a lot of
places, got rejected from most, got a lowball offer, applied some more,
did well on some interviews, were crap on others, studied, applied some
more, got an offer, got rejected some more, got another offer,
negotiated, accepted an offer from a sweet tech company for $80-100k+
and started their jobs happily collecting their paychecks.  The really
good ones then pay it forward to their fellow App Academy alums and get
them interviews and jobs at all the places they got offers or interviews
from.

A job hunt can be draining. But you shall find a job before you are fully
drained. You will feel judged, you will feel inadequate. Oh well. There
is a sweet job and a sweet new life waiting for you at the end of this
road. If you work hard, it's yours.

## (Typical) Application Process Overview

The application process is pretty much the same everywhere:

  1. Apply by email
      
      This usually entails sending a cover letter (i.e. the email
      itself) and resume to the company's HR/recruting person. Your
      cover letter would include relevant links to GitHub, projects,
      LinkedIn, etc.

  2. Phone screen with recruiter

      The recruiter/HR person will call you and ask about your
      background and get a feel for you as a person and a technical
      candidate. This may entail basic technical questions,
      but the questions will be very basic, often with one-word answers
      ("buzz-word" questions).

  3. Technical phone screen

      You will have a phone interview with an engineer or two. They will
      ask you technical questions (we will cover the general areas they
      may ask about) which you will usually be solving in code in an
      online text editor (like Stypi). This will usually last 1 hour.

  4. Technical in-person interviews

      This is the final stage in the interview process. You will usually
      go on-site for this interview and meet with anywhere from 3-4+
      people over the course of 3-6+ hours. You will have multiple
      technical interviews where you will solve technical problems on a
      whiteboard and/or a computer (possibly yours, so make sure to
      bring it. This is the most challenging
      phase and the one with the highest chance of yielding you an
      offer. Different companies handle this phase differently and so
      they may break it up over two days, have different numbers of
      interviewers, etc. but it will usually be a half-day/full-day
      process with multiple interviews (technical and cultural).

  5. Final Response
      
      A company will usually get back to you within a couple weeks from
      your on-site interviews with their final response. If they are
      giving you an offer, they will usually tell you over the phone and
      then send the related paperwork. DO NOT accept the first offer you
      get. Always thank the company for the offer and let them know
      you're interviewing other places; ask if you could have two weeks
      to get back to them.  If they do not give you an offer, thank them
      for considering you as a candidate, ask them for some feedback to
      help you improve in other interviews, and be on your merry way.

  6. Negotiation and Decision

      The position you want to be in: two offers from two companies you
      like. You then play one against the other to improve your pay by
      $5-10k+, and then accept the offer you consider best. Sign on the
      dotted line and let any other companies from whom you had an offer
      (or were in the middle of the interview process) know that you've
      accepted an offer elsewhere.  Thank them for the offer (or for
      considering you as a candidate) and be on your merry way. Let them
      know about other App Academy students who may be good fits for the
      role. Congratulations, you're done. You are now officially a
      successful App Academy alum.

## Numbers, Numbers, Numbers

Note that each step has a big success dropoff rate. So, 100 applications
results in 20 phone screens which results in 5 technical screens which
results in 1 offer. Maybe. These are obviously rough numbers and your
mileage may vary.

Your job hunt is, in part, a numbers game. You will be sending out many,
many, many applications, and you will interview at many, many, many
places. A few will work out. Most will not. That is absolutely fine and
to be expected. 

Our most successful students put in the most work in this final leg of
the process. They applied to the most number of places, interviewed the
most, and got the most offers. And these students were usually also the
ones who started the process the earliest and moved the fastest. You
will all learn from their success.

## What Matters at Each Step

We'll cover just the steps up to getting the offer:

  1. Application
  2. HR Phone Screen
  3. Technical Phone Screen
  4. On-Site Interviews

### 1. Application

**Most important thing: personal project(s)**

*Necessary:*

  * Short (< 10 sentences), congenial cover letter (i.e. email) presenting
    yourself, your intention, and your interest in the company.
  * Short (not longer than 1 page), clear resume with skills highlighted
    and primary projects described (with technologies used).
  * Easy links to personal portfolio/project(s) on resume and in cover
    letter.

What you'll be doing:

  * Drafting a generic cover letter that will be altered slightly for
    each company. You will trade this with others for review & edit.
  * Drafting a resume and trading for review & edit.
  * Cleaning up your GitHub account
  * Polishing your projects (good READMEs, deployed, guest accounts for
    ones that require login, screenshots if necessary, improve styling &
    presentation, fix functionality, etc.)
  * Finding places to apply (company lists, meeting people, online job
    boards, events, etc.)

### 2. HR Phone Screen

**Most important thing: Being able to answer questions on your resume
and your projects.**

One of the things this will entail is how you present your experience at
App Academy and your current skill level. Know that you are a competent
Ruby/Rails and JavaScript/Backbone developer. You do not need to (nor
should you) pitch yourself as an eager beginner who wants to find a
place you can be mentored and taught. You will learn a ton wherever you
work, and hopefully you will have many excellent mentors, but you're
also immediately useful. You're a developer. Not a junior developer, not
an entry-level developer, not an aspiring developer. You are a
developer.

The HR person will likley also want to make sure you've done your
homework on the company. So do your homework on the company. They may
ask why you're interested in the company. Have a good answer.

What you'll be doing:

  * Practice resume questions with others
  * Get to know the company you're applying to

### 3. Technical Phone Screen + On-Site Interviews

**Most important thing: performance on technical interview questions**

These two stages are grouped together because the criterion upon which
you will be judged is the same: your performance on the technical
interview questions. 

What you'll be doing:

  * Practice, practice, practice (alone and with others)
  * Study
  * Practice more

## Note on Job Requirements

**Ignore job requirements**. If a place is hiring a 'senior' Rails dev,
they may want entry-level people, too. Look up if there is a more
appropriate position to apply for on their company website. Send a
resume to the most relevant, even if it doesn't look like a perfect fit.
Lots of companies have openings they don't list.

Furthermore, if it says Python or Django or JavaScript, you're good for
those too. Apply. If you see a bunch of additional technologies on the
job requirements list that you don't know, don't worry about it. Apply,
let them take a look at your projects and resume, and let them decide if
they'd like to talk to you. Oftentimes they simply pack the requirements
list with a lot of "nice-to-haves." 

Definitely don't be deterred by a requirement of a 4-year degree. All
companies simply want competent developers and they have their various
strategies of going about finding those developers. You are a competent
developer, so apply and see if you and the company are a good fit.


## GitHub

Now is the time to clean up your repos!

* Remove early projects
* Remove unfinished projects
* Make sure that all projects have custom READMEs and descriptions
* Fix code style and refactor! This is your portfolio. Make it
  something that you are proud of, and is the most accurate
  representation of the best code that you can write.

## Technical Interview (i.e. "Whiteboarding") Style

* Be confident; even if you don't know the answer, try to engage the
  problem, don't give up. 
* Take a few seconds to think about the problem before starting. You
  don't have to have the whole solution in your head; these problems
  are meant to be worked over on a board. But you should have a bit of
  direction.
* Ask clarifying questions as necessary.
* Talk through the problem; they want to see the process going on in
  your head. If you don't talk, the interviewer doesn't learn how you
  break-down and analyze a problem.
* Don't feel that you have to rush through things. Be methodical and go
  only as quickly as your logic process allows.
* The interviewer may give you hints. They will ask questions to keep
  you on track - pay attention to these. 
* If you get flustered or nervous, remember that the whole idea is to
  work through the problem - it should entail some struggle and sticking
  points. Just keep talking and working through it. Maybe take a second
  to step back and think.
* Don't explicitly ask for hints, though. If you are truly stuck
  or don't know how to begin, ask questions.
* Start by solving a simpler version of the problem, or provide a very
  simplistic solution, even if it is slow, just to get get some
  partial credit points on the board. It often also helps to have
  something up to polish and edit instead of trying to do it perfectly
  from scratch.
* If they ask "Does this work?", take a moment to think. Walk through
  the code step-by-step (out loud is fine). If you say yes, say it like
  you believe it - interviewers don't like to think people are just
  praying they'll get the answer right.
* If you hit a hard part or see a mistake in your code/logic, tell the
  interviewer that you recognize that your approach to the problem has
  hit a snag, and that you'll have to fix something.
* Listen to the interviewer. They are trying to help you. They get
  annoyed if they feel like you don't listen.

## The Plan

Everyday for the next 3-9 weeks (until you're jobbed), you will be
working along two tracks:

  1. Getting interviews (applications & phone screens)
  2. Nailing interviews (technical interviews)

There is a daily schedule provided for you. We'll be adjusting as we go
to focus on areas that need more attention, but it should provide a good
basic framework.


## Documents

Staying organized during this process will be important. There will be
two documents that you will keep updated throughout your job hunt
process.

  1. Application spreadsheet: you will each have your own spreadsheet of
     all the companies you're applying to along with the status of your
     application process.
  2. Interview problem spreadsheet: there will be one master list of
     interview problems. Every time you have an interview (HR call,
     technical phone screen, in-person), you will record as many
     questions as you can remember in that list. 

These lists will be enormously valuable to you, to your classmates, and
to future App Academy students. Maintain them meticulously.
