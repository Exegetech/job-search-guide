# Current Trends in Tech

## Some Factors
Cheaper servers + more powerful browsers
--> the cloud
    --> rich client apps, saas (SFDC)
    --> continuous deployment, agile instead of waterfall, from architecture
--> with mobile: seamless integration between devices

REST & APIs
--> More data going around

More UX Conventions
  --> consumer-grade UX for enterprise
    --> less customer support (Dropbox), lower costs, "low touch, low friction".


## Some Terms

\*aaS
Saying a business is "as a service" has 2 meanings:
1. Comes in the browser, not on a CD ROM (most commmon)
2. Outsource something that would normally be done in-house
  This is often done for a monthly fee and through the browser
so it's very related (eg. platform as a service, varnish as a service)
