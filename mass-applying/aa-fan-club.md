## San Francisco

### Name: Game Closure

email xiaowei.deng@gmail.com

We are a well-funded kickass mobile game tech company looking for an
awesome software engineer: you. You will be working on some of the
world's most interesting tech with a small group of 10-15 talented
engineers, artists, product managers. 

We write cross-compilers, custom browsers, arm7 assembly, gpu shaders,
nodejs & python back-ends, Javascript Game APIs, and whatever else it
takes to solve the problems of mobile game development in the modern
ecosystem. You will work with the best engineers in the world -- we have
top talent in every part of our stack, from server architecture to
browser optimization to Android internals -- on the hardest problems in
mobile and social gaming, and create beautiful, frictionless games. If
you want to join a great team, develop cutting-edge technology and have
an impact, then we want to talk to you. 

BE READY TO TAKE A CODE SIMULATION TEST.


WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR // WHAT YOU'LL DO

You're strong in JavaScript, but well versed in other languages. You
could be a generalist who has a propensity for building servers or a
specialist but above building a kick-ass server, you will play a pivotal
role in creating a platform which will revolutionize the future of game
development. 

We don't have an exhaustive list of criteria for this role -- we're
still at the size where we can still fit the role around the individual
and their interests (rather than the other way around). Simply put,
we're looking for hands-on engineering talent from any industry as long
as you enjoy the challenge that'll come with building a next-gen gaming
platform. 

WHAT WE OFFER

In addition to a great work environment and solid compensation and
benefits, we also offer:

- Ownership: We're a small team, and we empower our people to pursue
  novel approaches.
- Challenge(s): What we're doing isn't easy. We're working every day to
  solve the hardest problems in mobile game development.
- Skills: There's zero stagnation here. We use the latest tools and
  technologies every day. You can touch all parts of the stack and see
your influence on real, shipping products
- Creative input: Ideas are valued from all corners of Game Closure, and
  we work fast -- that idea can go from concept to live in short order.
- Community. We hang out together. We take care of our people and
  believe it makes us stronger as a company. We enjoy working together
and relaxing together.
- Unlimited vacation! We recognize people for their hard work, and give
  them the vacation they need!
