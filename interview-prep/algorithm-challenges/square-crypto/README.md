Implement a classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

To begin, the input is first normalized: The spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is downcased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  These rows can be regarded as forming a square or rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the
length of the message.

If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16,
25, 36, etc), use that number of columns.

If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of
columns that corresponds to the smallest square that is larger than the
number of characters in the message.

For example, a message 4 characters long should use a 2 x 2 square. A
message that is 81 characters long would use a square that is 9 colums
wide.

A message between 5 and 8 characters long should use a rectangle 3
characters wide.

For example, the sentence

> If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots

is 54 characters long.

Broken into 8-character columns, it yields 7 rows.

Those 7 rows produce this rectangle when printed one per line:

```plain
ifmanwas
meanttos
tayonthe
groundgo
dwouldha
vegivenu
sroots
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.

The output is then grouped by column, with a space in between each group.

For example, the message above is coded as:

```plain
imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn sseoau
```

Write a program that, given an English text, outputs the encoded version
of that text.


Another example:

- "Have a nice day. Feed the dog & chill out!"
  - Normalizes to: "haveanicedayfeedthedogchillout"
  - Which has length: 30
  - And splits into 5 6-character rows:
    - "havean"
    - "iceday"
    - "feedth"
    - "edogch"
    - "illout"
  - Which yields a ciphertext beginning: "hifei acedl vâ€¦"
