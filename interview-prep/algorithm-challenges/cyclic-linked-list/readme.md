## Finding a cycle in a Linked List

1. Students are given the starting node of a Linked List.
   Each Node has the following properties: value, next
2. Students must then find if there is a cycle in the Linked List.
   (A cycle is when a node points to an earlier node in the Linked List, creating a loop.
3. Caveat: students cannot use any additional data structures. No arrays, no objects, no maps, etc.
