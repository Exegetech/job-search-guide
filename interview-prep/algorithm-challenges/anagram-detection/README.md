Anagram Detection


Slides: http://slides.com/lindakung417/anagram-detection/#/

Difficulty: Easy

#### Problem

1. You are given an array of strings only (could be words, phrases etc).
2. Create a function to find all the anagrams within that array. 
3. The output should be an ordered list - each row displaying a word and all of its anagrams.
4. Your function output should ignore all words that are not anagrams.

#### Example and Output

var words = ["cat", "act", "ignore", "a phrase", "tape", "pate", "e hpsara"];

1. cat, act
2. a phrase, e hpsara
3. tape, pate
