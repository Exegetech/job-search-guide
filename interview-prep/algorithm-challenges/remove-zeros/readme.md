##Remove Zeros

###Problem
Given an array of elements of arbitrary length, move all elements that are zero to the end of the array. Easy, right?

###Here's the catch:
1. You may NOT use any Array.prototype methods. (pop, splice, slice, sort, etc.)
2. You may NOT use any Object.prototype methods.
3. You may NOT use any temporary Arrays or Objects
4. You must preserve the order of non-zero AND zero elements.
