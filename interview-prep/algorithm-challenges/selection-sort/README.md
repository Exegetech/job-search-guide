*Sorting* is an important problem in programming, because having a sorted array can drastically increase performance on large data sets from dealing with them in an unsorted way.  For this *REACTO*, we're going to be implementing a sorting algorithm called *Selection Sort* and thinking about its time and space efficiency.

*Selection Sort* is an algorithm that repeatedly searches through the array for the item that should go next in the sorted array and puts it there.  

Implement `selectionSort(array)`, where the sort is done in place.  (In-place sorting means that you don't create any extra arrays to help in your sorting process.)
