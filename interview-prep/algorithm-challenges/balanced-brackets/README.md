#Balanced Brackets
Slides: http://slides.com/angieyang/reacto-3-4/
### Write a function that determines whether an input string has balanced brackets. ###

#### Problem ####
You are given an input string consisting of only brackets---  square [   ] , round (   ) , and curly {    } . Write a function that returns either true if the brackets in the input string are balanced and false if they are not. Balanced means that any opening bracket of a particular type must also have a closing bracket of the same type. 

#### Examples ####

    hasBalancedBrackets('[][(){}')
    //this should return false
    hasBalancedBrackets('text ( is allowed ){rwwrwrrww [] ()}')
    //this should return true
