# REACTO

* **R**epeat: state the problem to check comprehension
* **E**xamples: consider possible use and edge cases
* **A**pproach: state strategy for accomplishing goal
* **C**ode: implement strategy in a written program
* **T**est: check that example cases pass correctly
* **O**ptimize: discuss ways of improving performance

…is a strategy for handling whiteboard-style coding interviews and basic problem solving. This repo contains sample REACTO problems used by Fullstack Academy to prepare students for onsite interviews.

## Repo Structure

Each problem will go in its own directory containing the following:

* Required: a README.md
    - Thoroughly defines/states the problem in a way that can be sent directly to students
    - Optional but recommended: problem metadata
        + Difficulty: *easy*, *medium*, *hard*
        + Log of each date/cohort the problem was used for
* Optional but recommended: a JavaScript solution file
    - Implements at least one working solution
    - Is well-commented, highlights core concepts (e.g. recursion, OOP)
    - Includes any sample variables that may be required to test it

## Delivering Problems to Students

There are three major teaching phases involved in the REACTO process, which occur in order.

#### Introductory phase: 1–3 problems

The first time students are introduced to REACTO should be a group process in which every step is carefully explained. The first problem will be demonstrated in a skit between two instructors.

#### Group phase: ~5+ problems

The next few problems should be practiced in a managed group setting, with the instructor acting as an "interviewer" and each student working for several minutes before switching with the next student. Ideally a whole class should get the opportunity to contribute to a problem. Instructors can act as interviewers with different personality types (helpful, challenging, etc.) to better prepare students for possible real-world scenarios.

#### Paired phase: open-ended

Later REACTO exercises can be introduced by an instructor and then executed by pairs of students, with each acting as an interviewer or applicant and switching roles at least once. The instructor's role will be to facilitate, answering questions and redefining the problem if necessary, as well as checking progress.
