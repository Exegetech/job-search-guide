#Stack Minimum
Slides: https://slides.com/seemaullal/reacto-3-8-10


#### Problem ####
Recall that a stack is a last in first out data structureâ€“ data is always added to and removed from the top.

You need to implement a Stack data structure that has the following functions:
 - `push(value)` //to add elements (to the top of the stack)
 - `pop()` // removes the top element and returns its value
 - `min()` //returns the minmum element

All of the above functions should run in constant ( O(1) ) time.

No arrays or array methods should be used.
