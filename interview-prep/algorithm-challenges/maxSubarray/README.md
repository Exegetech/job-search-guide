<a href="http://slides.com/justinsung/reacto#/" target="_blank">Slides<a/>
###Goal
1. You are given an array of integers
2. Find the subarray that has the maximum sum
3. A subarray is one that can be made in a single slice operation. You do not have to consider any kind of wrapping around
4. Return that array
5. Attempt to do this in O(n) time

###Example

```
var array = [ -2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4];
console.log(maxSubArray(array));
//should output [ 4, -1, 2, 1 ];
```
