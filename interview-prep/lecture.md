# Sell yourself
* Be enthusiastic about the question.
* Don't stop until they tell you to.

# Communicating / Collaborating
* Don't hesitate to say "I don't know but..." and then guess.
* Draw forks in the road, then *ask* your interviewer which path to
  take.

# Thinking through a problem
* How do you implement a new feature?
* You don't build it all at once and then test it.
* You *can't* build it all at once because you're not even sure what
  it'll look like.

# Working through design problems
* Start with a roadmap.
* Subproblem > program > technology > implementation
