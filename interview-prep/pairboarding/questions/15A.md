## `streaming_sample`

You know how to use `rand` to randomly sample an element from an
array.

Now, write a function that, given an input stream of objects, will
sample a value. The stream has limited length.

* Use only `O(1)` memory.
* Every value in the stream should have an equal probability of being
  sampled.

### Solution

```
def streaming_sample(stream)
  sample = nil
  num_els = 0

  while true
    next_value = stream.next_value
    break if next_value.nil?

    # keep sample with probability num_els / (num_els + 1)
    keep_prob = num_els.fdiv(num_els + 1)
    sample = next_value if rand() < keep_prob

    num_els += 1
  end

  sample
end
```

Let's prove this works by **induction**. First, note that for `num_els
= 1`, this says we keep the previous sample (`nil`), with probability
`0`. So after 1 element, every element has an equal chance of being
sampled (the only element is selected with probability `1`).

Next, assume that we've iterated through `m` elements, and that the
streaming sample has selected an element (so far) with equal
probability `1/m`. Then the probability of keeping the current sampled
element after considering the `m + 1`th element is `1 / m * m / (m +
1) == 1 / (m + 1)`. Likewise, the probability of selecting the `m +
1`th element is `1 / (m + 1)`.
