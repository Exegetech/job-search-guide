## `fast_intersection`

Given `arr1` and `arr2`, find the intersection of both sets. It should
be trivial to write an `O(n**2)` solution. Use sorting to solve in
`O(nlog(n))`. Next, improve this to `O(n)` time (maybe use a non-array
datastructure).

```ruby
def intersection1(arr1, arr2)
  arr1.select { |el| arr2.include?(el) }
end

def intersection2(arr1, arr2)
  arr1, arr2, idx1, idx2 = arr1.sort, arr2.sort, 0, 0

  intersection = []
  while idx1 < arr1.length && idx2 < arr2.length
    case arr1[idx1] <=> arr2[idx2]
    when -1
      idx1 += 1
    when 0
      intersection << arr1[idx1]
      idx1 += 1
      idx2 += 1
    when 1
      idx2 += 1
    end
  end
  intersection
end

require 'set'
def intersection3(arr1, arr2)
  set1 = Set.new

  arr1.each { |el| set1 << el }
  arr2.select { |el| set1.include?(el) }
end
```

## `common_subsets`

Write a function that takes two arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) of integers
and returns an array with all the subsets commmon to both.

Don't generate all subsets of `arr1` and `arr2`, which would take time
exponential in the size of `arr1`/`arr2` (and take `O(2**n)` memory as
well). Instead, directly generate the subsets of both.

```ruby
def common_subsets(arr1, arr2)
  subsets(itersection3(arr1, arr2))
end

def subsets(arr)
  return [[]] if arr.empty?

  val = arr[0]
  subs = subsets(arr.drop(1))
  new_subs = subs.map { |sub| sub + [val] }

  subs + new_subs
end
```

## `canWin`

Given an array and index, find if it's possible to reach 0 by starting
at the index and repeatedly moving left/right by the distance found at
`array[index]`.

Hint: Use memoization to record where you've been.

```ruby
# A non-recursive solution.
def can_win(array, start_index)
  positions_to_try = [index]
  visited_positions = []

  until positions_to_try.empty?
    position = positions_to_try.shift
    value = array[position]

    if value == 0
      return true
    end

    pos1 = position + value
    if (0 <= pos1 && pos1 < array.length) && !visited_positions[pos1]
      positions_to_try << pos1
    end

    pos2 = position - value
    if (0 <= pos2 && pos2 < array.length) && !visited_positions[pos2]
      positions_to_try << pos2
    end
  end
  false
end
```
