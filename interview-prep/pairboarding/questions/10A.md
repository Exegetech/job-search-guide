## `binary`

Write a function that takes an integer and returns it in binary form.

```ruby
def binary(num)
  result = []

  until num == 0
    result.unshift(num % 2)
    num /= 2
  end

  result.join
end
```

## Factorial

Implement factorial with and without recursion. What is a potential
disadvantage of the recursive way?

What is tail-recursion? Does Ruby have tail-call optimization? Pretend
it did; write a tail-recursive version of `rec_fac`.

```ruby
# Uses O(n) memory for the stack since Ruby doesn't have TCO.
def tail_rec_fac(num, prod = 1)
  return prod if num == 1
  return tail_rec_fac(num - 1, prod * num)
end

def iter_fac(num)
  product = 1
  2.upto(num) { |i| product *= i }

  product
end
```
