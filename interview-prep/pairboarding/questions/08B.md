## `StackQueue`

Implement a queue using stacks. That is, write `enqueue` and `dequeue`
using only `push` and `pop` operations.

In terms of performance, `enqueue` should be `O(1)`, but `dequeue` may
be worst-case `O(n)`. In terms of ammortized time, `dequeue` should be
`O(1)`. Prove that your solution accomplishes this.

```ruby
class StackQueue
  def initialize
    @in, @out = [], []
  end

  def enqueue(value)
    @in << value
  end

  def dequeue
    if @out.empty?
      @out << @in.pop until @in.empty?
    end

    @out.pop
  end
end
```

## `largest_continuous_subsum`

Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest
continuous subsum (sum of a subarray).

You can solve this trivially in `O(n**2)` time by considering all
subarrays. Try to solve it in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` memory.

Hint: first figure out (in `O(n)` time), the best subsum that ends at
each position `i`. What is the relationship between the best subsum
ending at `i`, and the best subsum ending at `i + 1`?

```ruby
def lcs(arr)
  lcs_helper(arr)[:best_sum]
end

def lcs_helper(arr)
  if arr.empty?
    { :best_sum => 0, :best_suffix_sum => 0 }
  end

  old_best_sum, old_best_suffix_sum = lcs_helper(arr.drop(1))

  new_best_suffix_sum = [old_best_suffix_sum + arr.last, arr.last].max
  new_best_sum = [old_best_sum, new_best_suffix_sum].max

  { :best_sum => new_best_sum,
    :best_suffix_sum => new_best_suffix_sum }
end
```
