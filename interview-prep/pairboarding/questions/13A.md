## `rand7`

Write a method to generate a random integer `(0...7)`, given a method
that generates a random integer between `(0...5)`. The resulting rand7
distribution must be uniform.

```ruby
def rand7
  while true
    # construct a random number (0...5**2)
    num = 5 * (rand5) + rand5
    return (num % 7) if num < 21

    # we reject 21, 22, 23, 24; we'll choose another number in that
    # case.
  end
end
```

## Matchsticks

You have two sticks and a matchbox. Each stick takes exactly an hour
to burn from one end to the other.

The sticks are weird, in that they do not burn at a steady. If you
break a stick in half, it is not guaranteed that each half will take
30min to burn.

How would you measure exactly 45 minutes by burning these sticks?

```
Take stick1, light it at both ends. At the same time, light stick2 at
one end.

When stick1 is extinguished, 30min have passed. Now, light stick2 at
the other end. The stick will take another 15min to finish burning.
```
