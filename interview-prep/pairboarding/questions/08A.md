## Sums Upon Sums

I give you a scrambled list of `n - 1` unique integers between 0
and `n`. Tell me what number is missing?

If I let you use `O(nlog(n))` time, what is a naive way of doing this?

Next, what if I require that you solve the problem in `O(n)` time?
What datastructure might you use?

Finally, how could you solve the problem in `O(n)`, and also `O(1)`
space?

```
(a) You can sort and then go through the numbers looking for a gap.
(b) You can use a hash set, stick all the numbers in the set, and then
    probe for each number.
(c) The expected sum of the first `n` numbers is `(n + 1)(n / 2)`
    (prove this). Sum up all the numbers yourself, and subtract the
    actual from expected values. This number must be missing.
```

## `bonus_stack`

Implement a stack with a  method `max` that returns the maximum
value of the stack. `max` should run in `O(1)` time.

```ruby
class MaxStack
  def initialize
    @values = []
  end

  def push(value)
    if values.empty?
      @values << [value, value]
    else
      new_max = [self.max, value].max
      @values << [value, new_max]
    end
  end

  def pop
    value, max = @values.pop

    value
  end

  def max
    @values.last[1]
  end
end
```
