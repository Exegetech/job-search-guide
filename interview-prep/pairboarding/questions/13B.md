**How would you write a program to solve Sudoku? (high level description)**

1. Loop through all the empty cells, and for each cell generate a list of possible values. If a cell has only one possible value, fill it in.
2. Starting from the cells that have the shortest list of possible values, try the value, and recurse to see if the puzzle can be solved.


**Implement a square root function that uses only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in less than linear time. You may assume that input is always a perfect square.**

You know it won't be as fast as constant time, so it's gotta be logarithmic. What's our favorite logarithmic algorithm? Binary search!

  ```ruby
    def sqroot(num, candidates = nil)      
      candidates ||= (0..num / 2).to_a
      middle = candidates.length / 2
      case num <=> (candidates[middle] * candidates[middle])
      when -1
          sqroot(num, candidates.take(middle))
      when 0
          middle
      when 1
          sub_answer = sqroot(num, candidates.drop(middle + 1))
          (sub_answer.nil?) ? nil : (middle + 1) + sub_answer
      end
    end
  ```
