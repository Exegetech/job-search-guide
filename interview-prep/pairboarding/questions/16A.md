**(From LeanData)Write a method that takes an array and returns its duplicate values. Use less than O(n*n) time.**

  ```ruby
     def duplicates(arr)
         values = Set.new
         copies = Set.new
    
         arr.each do |value|
          if values.include?(value)
           copies << value
          else
           values << value
          end
         end
    
         return copies
    end
  ```

**(Also LeanData) Write a method that takes a hash of symbol keys, for which the values are integers representing each key's weight. The method returns a key such that the chances of selecting a particular key are weighted by that key's value.**

**For the hash {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3}, the chance of returning :c is 1/2, :b is 1/3, and :a is 1/6.**

  ```ruby
    def choose_a_record(weights)
      total_weights = 0
      keys = []
    
      weights.each do |key, value|
          total_weights += value
          keys << key
      end
    
      arr = [0]
      
      weights.each do |key, value|
          arr << arr.last + value * 1.0/total_weights
      end
    
      random_number = Math.rand
      i = 0
    
      while i < arr.length
          if random_number.between(arr[i], arr[i+1])
              return keys[i]
          end
      end
    end
  ```
