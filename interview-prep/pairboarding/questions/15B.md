## `filterLinkedList`

Write a double-ended `LinkedList` class in JavaScript.

* You should have a `Link` class
    * Write `next` and `prev` methods.
    * You should write a `remove` method.
    * You should write an `insert` method that inserts an item after
      the current link.
* You should have a `LinkedList` class
    * It should have `first` and `last` methods to return the
      first/last links in the list.
    * It should have `push` and `pop` methods.

Given a linked list of integers and an integer value, delete every
node of the linkedlist containing that value. Use JavaScript.

## `median`

Given two **sorted** arrays, find the median element amongst the two
arrays. That is, if both arrays were combined, find the median element
from the combined array. Assume that there is not enough memory to
actually combine both arrays. There exists an O(log n + log m)
solution.

```
Since they are sorted, you can find the middle element of each to find
the medians of each list. The actual median is now somewhere in
between these two numbers. You can then discard the non-relevant
portions of each list. Repeat the process. When the middle elements
from both lists converge, you have now found the median element.
```
