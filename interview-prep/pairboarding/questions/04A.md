## `uniq_subs`

Write a method that finds all the unique substrings for a word.

A results array and the `include?` method can be used to enforce
uniqueness, but it adds the time cost of iterating through that array
to check for inclusion. Keeping track of substrings in a hash is more
efficient.

```ruby
def uniq_subs(str)
  subs = {}

  str.length.times do |i|
    (i...str.length).each do |j|
      subs[str[i..j]] = true
    end
  end

  subs.keys
end
```

Time complexity: `O(n^2)`.

## `sum`

You are given an array with integers (both positive and negative) in
any random order. Find the sub-array with the largest sum.

```ruby
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem

def max_sub_sum(arr)
  max = 0
  max_l = 0
  max_r = 0
  current_max = 0
  left = 0
  
  arr.size.times do |i|
    current_max += arr[i]
    
    if current_max < 0
      left = i + 1
      current_max = 0
    elsif current_max > max
      max = current_max
      max_l, max_r = left, i
    end
  end
  
  arr[max_l..max_r]
end
```

Time Complexity: `O(n)`.
