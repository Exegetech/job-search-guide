## `next_largest`

Given a node in a Binary Search Tree, find the node with the next
largest value. Assume you don't have the root of the tree, just a
single node from it.

Perform an in-order traversal

```ruby
# O(log(n)) if BST is balanced
def next_largest(node)
  if node.right
    # find smallest node to the right
    return left_most_node(node.right)
  end

  # no nodes to the right; climb up
  until true
    parent_node = node.parent
    if parent_node.nil?
      # at the top of the tree, and nothing bigger to the right.
      nil
    elsif parent_node.left == node
      # parent is bigger than us
      return parent_node
    else
      # parent is smaller, keep climbing.
      node = parent_node
    end
  end
end

def left_most_node(node)
  # keep going down and to the left
  node = node.left until node.left.nil?

  node
end
```

## `isBalancedTree`

Write a JavaScript function to check if a binary tree is balanced. A
tree is balanced if, at every node, the number of nodes on the left
hand side is equal to the number of nodes on the right (plus or minus
one).

```js
function isBalanced (node) {
  return balancedWeight(node) != -1;
}

// O(n) time
function balancedWeight (node) {
  if (!node) {
    return 0;
  }

  var leftWeight = balancedWeight(node.left);
  var rightWeight = balancedWeight(node.right);

  if ((leftWeight == -1) || (rightWeight == -1)) {
    // one of the subtrees is unbalanced, so tree is unbalanced.
    return -1;
  }

  if (Math.abs(leftWeight - rightWeight) > 1) {
    // unbalanced!
    return -1;
  ]

  // total weight is weight of subtrees plus this node here.
  return leftWeight + rightWeight + 1;
}
```
