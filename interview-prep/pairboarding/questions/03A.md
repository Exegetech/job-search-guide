## `myMap`

Implement the `Array#map` function in JavaScript.

```js
Array.prototype.myMap = function(fn) {
  var final = [];
  this.forEach(function (el) {
    final.push(fn(el));
  }

  return final;
};
```

## Employees Query

In a SQL db, you have two tables, an employee table and a department
table. Employees belong to only one department. Given a department
name, find all the employees underneath it with a SQL query.

```sql
SELECT
  employees.*
FROM
  employees e
JOIN
  departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE
  d.name = ?
```
