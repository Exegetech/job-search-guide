## `find_missing_number`

Assume an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by
shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random
element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the
second array. Do this in linear time with constant memory use.

```ruby
def find_missing_number(array1, array2)
  array1.reduce(:+) - array2.reduce(:+)
end
```

Time complexity: `O(n)`.

## `is_shuffle?`

Given three strings, return whether the third is an **interleaving**
of the first two. Interleaving means it only contains characters from
the other two, no more no less, and preserves their character
ordering. "dabecf" is an interleaving of "abc" and "def". Note that
the first two strings needn't be in alphabetical order like these.

You may assume that the first two strings do not contain any
characters in common.

```ruby
# time: O(n), space: O(1)
def is_shuffle?(str1, str2, str3)
  return false unless str1.size + str2.size == str3.size
  
  idx1, idx2 = 0, 0

  str3.each_char do |chr|
    if str1[idx1] == chr
      idx1 += 1
    elsif str2[idx2] == chr
      idx2 += 1
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  true
end
```

Next, relax the assumption that the first two strings contain no
overlap. Analyze the time-complexity of your solution.

```ruby
# time: O(n^2), space: O(n)
def is_shuffle?(str1, str2, str3)
  return false unless str1.size + str2.size == str3.size
  seen = {}
  considering = [[0, 0]]

  str3.each_char do |chr|
    next_gen = []
    considering.each do |pair|
      next if seen[pair]
      seen[pair] = true
      idx1, idx2 = pair

      next_gen << [idx1 + 1, idx2] if str1[idx1] == chr
      next_gen << [idx1, idx2 + 1] if str2[idx2] == chr
    end
    considering = next_gen
  end

  !considering.empty?
end
```
