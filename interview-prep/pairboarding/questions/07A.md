## `jumble_sort`

Write a function that takes a string and returns it in alphabetical
order. One twist: it should take second argument, which is an array of
all the letters in the alphabet, in any order. Given that second
argument, the function should sort the string in the same order as the
letters in the array.

You can use the `Array` sorting methods.

A naive approach would be to look up the position of both letter in
the alphabet for each comparison of the sort. Be efficient and avoid
iteration through the entire alphabet for each comparison. Optimize
comparisons so that they are fast.

About how many times faster do you think you can make a single
comparison (compare worst-case to worst-case)?

```ruby
def jumble_sort(string, alphabet = ('a'..'z'))
  alphabet_hash = {}
  alphabet.each_with_index { |letter, index| alphabet_hash[letter] = index }

  string
    .chars
    .sort_by { |chr| index[chr] } # ~26x faster!
    .join
end
```

## `weighted_random_index`

Given an array, write a function that will return a random index of
the array. The probability of an index being returned is weighted by
the value at that index against the sum of the array values. For
example, for the array `[4, 6, 8]`, index 0 should be returned with 4
in 18 odds, index 1 should be returned with 6 in 18 odds, and index 2
should be return with 8 in 18 odds. Implement this in `O(n)` time.

```ruby
def weighted_random_index(arr)
  total_sum = arr.inject(:+)
  value = rand(total_sum)

  cumulative_sum = 0
  arr.each_with_index do |el, i|
    cumulative_sum += el
    return i if value < cumulative_sum
  end
end
```
