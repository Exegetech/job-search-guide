# Pairboarding

Before you get started, read the [tips][tips] on solving whiteboard
problems.

## Instructions

Pair with someone new every day. One in the pair takes question set A,
the other takes question set B. The interviewer has the problem and
its solution. He/she makes the other student, the interviewee, solve
the problem as if they were doing a real interview. The interviewer
cannot give out an actual answer, but should keep the interviewee on
track with leading questions. The interviewee cannot ask for a hint or
answer, but may ask insightful questions.

Give yourself time before starting, to make sure you understand the
problem you will give your interviewee as well as its solution. Keep
in mind that multiple solutions are likely valid.

You may not refer to the web unless the question assumes technical
knowledge that neither the interviewer nor the interviewee has
(eg. the nature of a certain data structure). When the interviewee has
found a solution, he or she should determine its time complexity and
try to optimize.

Finally, switch the roles with a new question set. If you are with an
odd number of people, one group of three can be composed of two
interviewers and an interviewee.

Question sets are organized below in incremental difficulty. Do them
in order.
