# Interviewing tips

## General Structure

The job hunt begins.

Most of your applications will follow this process:

* Apply
* HR Phone Screen (30 min)
* Technical Phone Interview (1 hour)
* In-Person Interview (3-6+ hours)
* Response

Let's go through each step:

1. **Apply**
    
    This stage is all about getting somebody on the phone for that
    first interview. If you have a contact at the place you're applying,
    that's your best best (check LinkedIn). If not, e-mail is usually
    best. Prefer a person's e-mail over a jobs@xyz.com.
    
    You getting an interview will be based on:
    
    * GitHub
    * Resume
    * Online portfolio site (if you have one)
    * Cover letter
    
    **Cover Letter**: Most of the time this will just be the e-mail you
    attach your resume to. Keep it short - people are busy. And make
    it easy for them: put links to your best projects on GitHub or
    Heroku at the bottom, attach your resume as a PDF (or even better
    just link to an online resume and/or portfolio site).

2. **HR Phone Screen**

    Your first contact with a company will often be with an HR person
    or internal recruiter. They will usually ask you about 
    your work and background along with some culture fit stuff. This
    doesn't often go longer than 30 minutes and sometimes you won't
    go through this step at all.
    
3. **Technical Phone Interview**

    This is the first major technical hurdle. The person interviewing
    you will usually be an engineer at the company and their goal is
    to figure out whether you have some basic technical chops - enough
    to make it worth their time to bring you in for a full-day in-person
    interview.
    
    You might get a pretty easy question to begin with (and sometimes
    it might actually be 'fizzbuzz') - this is their way of weeding out
    developers who don't actually know how to program. But some companies
    just dive into harder stuff. The questions will usually get a bit 
    harder as you go, and in total, they'll try to get 2-3 questions in.
    
    You'll usually be doing this on your computer in a Stypi or something 
    similar, where they can see you typing, and on a Skype call with them.
    Make sure you're somewhere comfortable and quiet with some sort of 
    hands-free headset/headphones. 

4. **In-Person Interview**

    For those technical phone interviews that go well, you'll head down
    to the company's offices for an in-person interview with several
    people who work there. At least a couple of these interviews will
    be technical; others will be more focused on culture fit.
    
    For the technical interviews, some of the interviewers might ask
    you to code something up on your laptop (so make sure you have it
    with you). Others will ask you to whiteboard a problem. See below
    for tips on whiteboarding.
    
    Prepare well for this segment of the application process. Do 
    practice probelms on your own beforehand, mock interview with
    others, etc. In general, **be prepared** and be honest.

5. **Response**

    After the in-person interview is complete, the company will 
    usually be ready to make a decision and will usually get back 
    to you within a week or so. Some companies will want to meet
    with you again and some companies take much longer to get back
    to you. Companies have different hiring practices, so just go
    with it.
    
    If all goes well, you'll get an offer from the company.
    Congrats! Don't just accept because you're so happy to get
    one though. Keep interviewing and get at least two offers
    on the table. Time to negotiate and decide. Check below
    for tips on negotiating.
    
    At any point in this process, the company may have told you
    that they didn't think you'd be a good fit. No big deal. 
    There are all sorts of reasons companies don't think a 
    candidate is a good fit and none of them are stopping you from
    applying to more companies, preparing well, and getting multiple
    good job offers. Every interview you do is practice for the
    next one. So, apply, prepare, get offers. 




## Apply to a lot of places

**Apply to a lot of places**. Somebody out there wants to hire you,
but you need to find that person. You don't know how quickly you'll
get offers, so don't be too choosy when applying; be choosy when you
have offers.

**A good goal is to send out 20 resumes a day.** A lot of entry-level
devs find jobs through [job listing boards](job-boards.md). Send a
resume to every company that is looking for Ruby, Rails, Python,
Django people. You'll hear back from ~1/10, but this just means send
out more resumes.

**Ignore job requirements**. If a place is hiring a senior Rails dev,
they probably want entry-level people, too. Look up if there is a more
appropriate position to apply for on their company website. Send a
resume to the most relevant, even if it doesn't look like a perfect
fit. Lots of companies have openings they don't list.

## Resume

* Limit to one page
* Focus strongly on your projects, technology.
* Lookup the right capitalization, spelling of the techs you used. It
  looks really dumb if you get this wrong.

## GitHub

Now is the time to clean up your repos!

* Remove early projects
* Remove unfinished projects
* Make sure that all projects have custom READMEs and descriptions
* Fix code style and refactor! This is your portfolio. Make it
  something that you are proud of, and is the most accurate
  representation of the best code that you can write.

## Whiteboarding style

* Be confident; even if you don't know the answer, try to engage the
  problem, don't give up. If you keep telling an interviewer you don't
  know how to do something, they'll start to believe you.
* Take a few seconds to think about the problem before starting. You
  don't have to have the whole solution in your head; these problems
  are meant to be worked over on a board. But you should have a bit of
  direction.
* Ask clarifying questions as necessary.
* Talk through the problem; they want to see the process going on in
  your head. If you don't talk, the interviewer doesn't learn how you
  break-down and analyze a problem.
* The interviewer may give you hints. They will ask questions to keep
  you on track. Don't be flustered or think you're failing; this is
  normal.
* Don't explicitly ask for hints, though. If you are truly stuck
  or don't know how to begin, ask questions.
* Start by solving a simpler version of the problem, or provide a very
  simplistic solution, even if it is slow, just to get get some
  partial credit points on the board.
* If they ask you "does this work", take a moment to think. Walk
  through the steps; out loud is fine. If you say yes, say it like you
  believe it; interviewers don't like to think people are just
  praying they'll get the answer right.
* If you hit a hard part, tell the interviewer that you recognize that
  your approach to the problem has hit a snag, and that you'll have to
  fix something.
* Listen to the interviewer. They are trying to help you. They get
  annoyed if they feel like you don't listen.

## Your questions when interviewing

**TODO**

* Read up on the company
* Tell me about something you worked on. What was the most difficult part.
* Read up on companies, see what they are hiring for.
* Have questions for them.

## Salary negotation
* If asked for salary expectations, just say that you want to be paid
  commensurate with what other people in your position are offered.
* If they press you, say that you are talking to many places and that
  you don't want to prejudge your salary before offers come in.
* If you get an offer, tell all other companies you are interviewing
  at. They will probably more quickly bring you in to interview.
* Even if you don't want to work somewhere, it can be worth
  interviewing to get additional offers to push up salary somewhere
  you do want to work. I strongly, **strongly** recommend interviewing
  everywhere that will have you.
* If you receive a second offer, tell other employers who have made
  you an offer (if it is more, I suppose). Ask for them to match it.
* Typical recruiters have discretion to increase an offer by $5k; you
  need to ask, though.
