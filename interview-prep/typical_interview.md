# Typical Interview

One of our students reported this interview process at his final round at a Bay Area cloud-computing solution provider. While you should be prepared for tougher grilling, this seems to be fairly standard.

1. Usual questions about your personal narrative and your learning history.
    * Questions about App Academy when it comes up: what you liked best, the most challenging point...
2. Go through the technologies listed on your résumé and ask about them to make sure you know what you're talking about.
3. General questions about working style: breaks or sprees, what you enjoy about coding, how you work in a pair...
4. Technical section: two 20-minute paring sessions
     * First Rails. Covers fundamentals such as basic datatypes, blocks and procs, scope, classes and modules.
     * Second JavaScript. Parsing data from an API. Tests JS fundamentals, chrome dev tools use and debugging.
