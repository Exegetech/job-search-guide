# Join the Open Source Movement

Shop around for some open source projects. Clone two or three interesting ones locally and read the code. Part of this exercise is setting up the proper environment to run the code. This will often require installing new libraries and debugging until everything works. Once your environment is set up try to implement new features.    

It's common at technical interviews to ask a candidate to fix a bug or implement a feature on top of an existing codebase. That codebase can be the company's actual product so it can be a lot of lines. Get used to finding your way around someone else's code.
