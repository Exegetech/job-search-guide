# Meetups you should go to

Create an account on [Meetup.com][meetup] if you don't have one already. Check off the interests that are relevant to you (web development, tech startups, ruby, ...) and sign up for the meetups below.    

These Meetups will hold events where you'll find free dinner, great networking and maybe even a job. The key is to show up many times to the same Meetup. Start by attending all of them. Then pick the ones that you find the most interesting and that seem like they have good networking (bad networking is when everyone else there is looking for a job). Then keep showing up to the good ones. You'll feel more and more comfortable as you start recognizing the other regulars and they start recognizing you. That's when the magic happens.    

Showing up early guarantees that you will get the free pizza and talk to more people.    

Stay on top of Meetup events by subscribing to their calendars. On the main page of a Meetup group, open the "Calendar" tab and scroll down to the bottom. The "iCal" link will give you a URL you can subscribe to with iCal or Google Mail. This way all upcoming events for that Meetup group will appear on your calendar.
