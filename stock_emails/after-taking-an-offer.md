#Once you've taken an offer

You took an offer and it's now time to tell the other companies the
"bad" news. Good problem to have right? Here's how you can take some
of the edge off.

Hi [name],

I'm writing to let you know I've accepted an offer and am no longer
available for hire. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview
at [company] and get to know your team better. I wish you the best going
forward.

To find talented engineers who are looking for opportunities in the area,
I highly recommend contacting App Academy where I learned web
programming. They teach an intensive course that only admits the top 5%
of applicants and I can say from personal experience that my class was
very strong. Feel free to ask Simon (simon@appacademy.io)
to send graduates your way.

Best,

Me
