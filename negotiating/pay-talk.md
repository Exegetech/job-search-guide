# Pay and Negotiation

## Discussions about pay

Companies will ask you how much you're expecting to get paid. DO NOT
EVER GIVE THEM A NUMBER. Always tell them that you're expecting
competitive offers commensurate with your skill level and that you're
sure that they will give you a fair offer.

Never, never, never be the first one to mention a number. You are almost
guaranteed to lowball yourself, or run the risk of betraying an
unrealistic expectation. Best to never give a number and wait.  Not
giving a number will have no bearing on whether you receive an offer or
on the final value of the offer you accept - so just never do it.

## Negotiating Offers

Negotiation is a standard part of the job application process. The most
important factor is the number of offers you have on the table, so
before negotiating, get multiple offers.

Once you have multiple offers, you can let the companies know about your
highest offer. Allow the companies to revise their offers
(should they choose to) and then make a final decision.

## Always be Civil

Always, always, always be kind, civil, courteous, and all other related good,
nice, congenial adjectives. The software development industry in SF is
not that big and you'll likely cross paths with many of the people you
talk to again. So always say thank you, don't do stupid things, stick to
your word, etc. etc.
