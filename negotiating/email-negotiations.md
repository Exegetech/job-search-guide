#Negotiation Emails

## After getting an offer

 As soon as you get an offer:    
1. Ask for two weeks to think about it. Odds are this is your first job as a web developer so you shouldn't be rushed to decide.    
2. Email every company you've contacted, even if they never got back to you. Tell them you have an offer elsewhere but you really like what their company does. You would love to go through their application process so that you can include them in your final decision.

These are the companies you should absolutely email. If you have a phone screen or interview scheduled with a company within three or four days, you can wait until then to let them know about your new offer.    

* Companies you've interviewed with and are waiting to hear back from. If you haven't written your standard thank-you-for-the-interview email, consolidate the two messages in the same email.
* Companies you have a phone screen / interview scheduled with in over four days.
* Companies that you haven't heard back from at all that seemed cool.

Here's a sample email for your inspiration.

*Hi [contact person/this company name],*

*I applied to join your team last week and am currently waiting to hear back. I wanted to let you know I've received another offer [from /company name/ if it's a good one]. I have two weeks to get back to them. While it's an interesting offer, I admire what [this company] does and would love to see your application process through before making a final decision. I hope to hear back from your team soon.*


*All the best,*

*Me*


## If they are in a hurry

Many companies will want you to decide in less than a week. Resist this. You're looking to make a
long-term commitment and it's in no-one's interest to rush your decision.
If they insist, that's because they want to lock you down before you get competing offers.
This puts you in a strong position to ask them for a higher offer.
Here's a stock email you take can inspiration from.


*My only concern is that I only started my job search a few weeks ago and am still in talks with several other companies. I have to consider the opportunity cost of taking myself off the job market before waiting to hear back from them. Could [company name] raise the base on the initial offer? Given a package with higher compensation I would be in a better position to cut those conversations short and start on the [date] as you request. Let me know.*



## If the offer is low

Do not fret over asking for more. Companies do not have feelings. They are however a lot more likely to invest in you and train you well if they're paying a fair market rate.

These are real emails written by students. The outcome was successful in both cases.    

**Example 1**: with no competing offers.    

*Thank you for extending me the offer of employment as a Junior  Developer at [company name].  I really enjoyed getting to meet with [interviewer name], [interviewer name], and [interviewer name] on Monday and think the team is definitely the right cultural fit for me.  Your company does some seriously interesting work and I think it's a great opportunity to learn skills that I won't find elsewhere.*

*In light of my skills, however, I am concerned about the salary you offered. App Academy is a rigorous program with a 5% acceptance rate and a 10% attrition rate.  This year App Academy graduates have been finding an average starting salary of $92,000. Given my track record of being a top performer, I see my market value as $95,000.  If you can put together that offer, I will sign immediately and cancel all other interviews.*

*Again, I am really looking forward to joining your team and can't wait to start on 9/23/2013 as you requested.  But in order to do that, I need you to make me a more competitive offer.*

**Example 2**: with competing offers.    

*Thanks for sending this over! I think [company name] is a great company, and that I'd be a good fit. My one apprehension right now is the compensation. $70,000 is on the low side of the offers I am considering, as well as what I am hearing from my App Academy peers. The average is closer to the $80-85 range. This Indeed search shows a $90,000 average for a Junior Application Developer in New York [links to Indeed search]. If you were able to raise the offer, I would feel much more comfortable accepting it.*

*I know we discussed that one of my favorite things about [company name] was that [employee], [employee], and [employee] had all been there for over three years. That kind of longevity is amazing, and exactly what I'm looking for. This is my first big leap as a developer, so I'm looking for a longterm, 2+ year position where I can grow. I know [company name] provides that environment, and I know I would be a valuable asset to the Apps team. I look forward to hearing from you!*
